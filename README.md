## Machine Learning
Finished by March 2017, offered on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) by Professor Andrew Ng from Stanford University.

## Below are the main topics of this course:
### 1. Supervised learning - labeled data
* Linear regression
* Logistic regression
* Neural networks
* Support vector machines

### 2. Unsupervised learning - unlabeled data
* K-means
* PCA
* Anomaly detection

### 3. Special applications/topics
* Recommender systems
* Large scale machine learning

### 4. Advice on building machine learning systems
* Bias and variance
* Regularization
* Deciding what to work on next when developing a system
* Evaluation of learning algorithms
* Learning curves
* Error analysis
* Ceiling analysis

## This folder contains 8 exercises focusing on:
* 1 Linear Regression
* 2 Logistic Regression
* 3 Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks 
* 4 Neural Networks Learning 
* 5 Regularized Linear Regression and Bias v.s. Variance 
* 6 Support Vector Machines
* 7 K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis 
* 8 Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems
